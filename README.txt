Nonhydrostatic version of ROMS (CROCO) developed by people in France. This is
an attempt to add the analytical effluent pipe configuration into this version. 
OCEAN is where Fortran code is stored. This is where to edit to configure pipe.
Run is where cppdefs.h, param.h, and infiles are. This is also where you compile.
Compile using jobcomp_maya_new
